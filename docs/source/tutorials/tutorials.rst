This section of the documentation contains a set of `Jupyter notebooks <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_
intended to demonstrate important features and common idioms of the ``sequencing`` package.

.. note::
   These notebooks assume familiarity with scientific Python and `QuTIP <http://qutip.org/>`_.

   If you are not familiar with the `scientific Python stack <https://docs.python-guide.org/scenarios/scientific/>`_ 
   or with QuTiP, it may be useful to check out some of the following resources first:

   - `Lectures on scientific computing with Python <https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures>`_
      - Lectures 0-4 are most relevant to ``sequencing``
   - `QuTiP documentation <http://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/guide.html>`_, especially the following sections
      - `Basic Operations on Quantum Objects <http://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/guide-basics.html#basic-operations-on-quantum-objects>`_
      - `Manipulating States and Operators <http://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/guide-states.html#manipulating-states-and-operators>`_
      - `Using Tensor Products and Partial Traces <http://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/guide-tensor.html#using-tensor-products-and-partial-traces>`_
      - `Lindblad Master Equation Solver <http://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/dynamics/dynamics-master.html>`_
