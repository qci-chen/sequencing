Here we adopt the convention that modes are ordered as
    |m_n, m_n-1, ..., m_1, m_0>.
Furthermore, the ordering is decided primarily by mode Hilbert space size:
modes with more levels go on the right.
Among modes with the same number of levels, the ordering is decided
alphanumerically from right to left. For example,
assuming all cavities have the same number of levels
and all qubits have the same, smaller, number of levels:
    |qubit1, qubit0, cavity2, cavity1, cavity0>

For the motivation behind this convention,
see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02086.pdf.
